# Compiler

This is a recursive descent compiler built for a systems software course. 
Capabilities include if-else statements, while loops, and multiple functions.
Code to be complied goes in a .mc file (micro c).
Code is tokenized, parsed, linked into a tree via recursive descent, then 
translated to 64-bit Intel assembly code.
